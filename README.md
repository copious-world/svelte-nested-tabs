# svelte-nested-tabs

This component lets you created nested tabs. 

The tabs are buttons that you may style (or use defaults). And, below the tabs (a row of buttons) will be the active panel.

## Overview
### Very quickly ...

| tab1 | *tab 2* | tab 3
-------------------------

> You will see an active tabs contents.
> 
>  Makes your day. (Say it's tab 2)
>

-------------------------

You may put any content into the panel. That may be another component or some text (rendered as html). The component may be another tab compnent.

### Gist of operation

You have to define a JSON structure in your application. 

The nested tabs will be made possible by setting a **component** field to the Tabs object, which you import from *sevlte-nested-tabs*.

The **component** field says what goes into a tab panel.
